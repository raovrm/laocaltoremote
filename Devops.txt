ls -la (if u c .git file that is repo)

Test will repo 
Sample,sample2--folder

WC = ls -l
Stage = git Status
Commit = git ls-files

For finding we go inside using CD and check git status.



git status we can chack the status
** touch: we can create multiple file
touch file4 file5 file6
multiple fies we add and commit
git add file4 file5 file6
git commit -m "commited all files to repo" file4 file5 file6
git add . = it pocks all files which are untacked and into stage
git commit -m "commit all files at time" .
git show = we can c last commit
	is shows Commit Id,Author,date and message
git show <commitid>
git show <author>

git log =  fetch the recent transations and ID's
git log --all
git log --oneline
git reset HEAD <filename> = we can recall the file from staging
git revert = undo commit
git revert <commitID>
git checkout --<filename> = undo the changes
git rm = remove a file and directory
Note: If remove afile using git rm it store the staging area.

git is-files for commit area

2 types
Public Reposetory --> every one access,searchble in Internet,free of cost
Private Repo --> not searcble in internet and who is having access they can access.

Once its done repo creation 3 things is required project level
Repo URL,Account ID and Pwd
** MONOLITIC ARCH_ APPLICATIONS-- ONly One Repo
**NON MONOLITIC -- CONTAINER -- APPLICATIONS_MULTPLE REPO's

** when we connect first time to github use below command
git clone <URL Link>
git remote -v == we can find URL's for github
** NO Stage concept on Server side.*****
git pull = fetch the files from Server to local and files sitting on working area and Commit area
git push = Local to Server and user name nd tocken.
For Create Tocken Go to GITHUB account settings-->Developer Settings-->Personal Access Tocken(PAT)-->Tocken Classic and click on new tocken.

Note: Tocken: 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

***********************************************
**Branching
Branching is code experments
We need to take copies and which is working we need to mere the LR
Finding how many Branches in the Repo
-->git branch
By default 1 and name is main
if you run same command in local repo name will be master
For Cteating new Branch
-->git branch <name>
for moving new branch
-->git  checkout <> and do changes like create are update,once its done we need to merge to main branch.
To move main below command and merge
--> git checkout main
-->git merge <branchname>
--> For Rename the branch name git branch -m <oldname> <new name>
--> fir delete Branch git branch -d <branch name>
.gitingore
what ever the files not required remote repo that time we use this command
We can create .gitignore file thorugh command line are UI level
-->touch .gitignore
git diff: difference Working are and Commit area
git diff -- staged (in Staging area and Commit area)
empty: git not reconiged empty floder
git rebase--> completely removed in server side 9past is past) -- very rare
git Spash --> very rare
git cherry -->very rare

*******************************************
Maven
Snonarqube
***Jenkins DBS*****
Every machine should have Java
** Not required Jenckis install on Slave Mechine
Steps1: Connect ec2 machine which we gave created 
2 Install Java and git
$ Mkdir Jenkins
sudo chmod 777 jenkins/
$ pwd           (/home/ec2-user)
3) sudo usermod -a -G wheel ec2-user  --> Admin roles for user

4) Install git: sudo yum install -y git
5) for install have search for Amazon Corretto 11 and follow the steps.
Once open the page select linux: installing on Amazon linux 2 and Amazon linux 2022 and select option no: 2
6) cd /usr/lib/jvm  : find all java version
	java -->/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-amazon-corretto.x86_64
	Maven--> /opt/apache-maven-3.9.2
7) sudo vi /etc/profile and add below lines end of the file
Export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-amazon-corretto.x86_64
Export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

***Installation of Maven on Client(Slave) --> Based on requirement build tool we need to instal like Maven,gradile,ant etc in our case Maven installing.


Sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/3.9.2/binaries/apache-maven-3.9.2-bin.tar.gz

Sudo vi /etc/profile.d/maven.sh
export M2_HOME=/opt/apache-maven-3.9.2
export PATH=:${M2_HOME}/bin:${PATH}

-->Integrate with Jenkins
1) check with SSH agent plugin is available on Jenkins
2) configure Manage Jenkins-->nodes-->New Node
	fill required details Remote root directory:/home/ec2-user/jenkins
	Label:Slave_linux_maven_builds
	Usage: use this node as much possible
	Lunch Method: Launch agent via SSH
	Host name: Slave machine IP address
	
****Pipelne*** 39

3 ways
1st --- Plugin Method Like Maven,Gradle..Least preferred choice.

2nd -- Full pack method
Majority of project code is written in a particular language complex framework.

3rd -- pipeline as code
A custom made build progress.,need to write script Groovy its from java

1)What is the Purpose of CI?
2)System Requirement of Jenkins:Java 1.8
3)where do u link a repo in project in jerkins:SCM
4) what is use build tool maven:
	build, publish, and deploy several projects at once for better project management.
5)System requirements for Sonhrqube: JDK 11 and above.
6) Use of creatting token in Sonhrqube:to integrate Jenkins 
7) where to check the build results: consult outputs.
8) Where to check system logs in Jenkins: Manage Jenkins,/var/log/jenkins/jenkins.log 
9) How to update a plugin in Jenkins:manage plugins-->
10) version of Jenkins plugin:2.0

**ANISIBL***40
configuration managenet tool/Deployment tool

**Agentbase: need to install client and server, with good security 
***agentless: only on the serever.

**Push and Pull Mechanism:
1. Pull : Client --> Server (puppet):Scripts written on sever but client will take scripts.
2. Push: Server --> Client (ansible): Scripts written on sever and push for all clients(Ex: Mobile)

System Requirements:
Server Must be linux,64 bit machine,Kernal version Should>=3.10,Python pre installed ,More than 1gb
Client can be Windows or linux OS.
Naming Conventions in Ansible:
If Licensed Enterprise Edition called: Ansible Tower.
If Open Source called Ansible Control Machine.

Sever and Client should same net work.
How to Find? First 3 octanes (192.168.43.20)
Should be on Static IP addresses.
